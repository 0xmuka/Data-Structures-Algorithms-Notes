## What is the data structure?

[https://scaler.com/topics/images/datat-structure-types-of-data-structure](https://scaler.com/topics/images/datat-structure-types-of-data-structure)

- a program is a set of instructions that performs operations in data.
    - so without `data instructions` cannot be performed
    - so `data structure` is an important part of this program
    - `data structure` is the way you organize the data in the mean memory during the execution time of a program
    - so depending on your requirements, you can choose a suitable data structure

### List of data structure

- physical data structure
    - that define how data is arranged in the memory
        1. Arrays
        2. Matrices
        3. Linked List
- Logical data structure
    
    that defined how can be utilized, how the arrangement is, and how is should be utilized
    
    1. Stack
    2. Queues
    3. Trees
    4. Graph
    5. Hashing

### **Static Memory Allocation**

- Memory allocated during compile time is called static memory.
- The memory allocated is fixed and cannot be increased or decreased by during runtime.

### **Dynamic Memory Allocation**

- Recourse
